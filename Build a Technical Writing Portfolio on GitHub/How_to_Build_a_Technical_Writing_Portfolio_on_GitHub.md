# How to Build a Technical Writing Portfolio Using GitHub ðŸš€

Even though I already had a portfolio showcasing my blogs and the social media content I have written in the past for my clients, it was recently brought to my attention by a recruiter that I also need to include a GitHub portfolio showcasing my technical writing skills.  

Shout out to her for this btw!

So now that I have done it, I wanted to share a few tips and tricks with you too! Keep reading to know how you can build your [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/Shivanimarathe169/Portfolio) today.

## 1. So, What Happened Next?

I will admit it. At first, when I heard her say it, I thought to myself, "I don't have the skills to do it" & "I don't have access to fancy courses to learn how to do it."

I wasted a few days being discouraged.  

Then it hit meâ€”about a year ago, a senior technical writer had recommended this fantastic Udemy course. And, of course, in true "I'll get to it later" fashion, I never actually bought it. Classic me! 

So I went ahead and purchased the course based on DITA XML. Later, I went on to purchase another Udemy course for Git & GitHub for writers.

After I successfully Velcroed myself to the chair and powered through those courses, I had to face the truth:

> My discouragement wasnâ€™t because of the lack of resourcesâ€”it was because of my laziness and fear of commitment.

(apparently, my fear of commitment extends to learning, too! :P).

## 2. How to Build a Technical Writing Portfolio Using GitHub?

Building a Technical Writing Portfolio using GitHub is a pretty straightforward procedure. All you need to do is create a profile, set up a repository, and start adding files to your repository. But, without the proper guidance, doing all of this can be tricky.

In this article, we will take a look through a set of simple tips & steps you can use to build a strong presence on the platform!

## 3. Tips & Steps to Follow to Build a GitHub Portfolio:

So, if you too, are a technical writer looking for technical writing portfolio ideas for GitHub, here are some things you can include in your portfolio to diversify it:

### A. Profile Overview:

Any Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub is incomplete without a proper profile overview. A profile overview can be used to input your live project or blog links outside GitHub or links to other GitHub repositories the visitors may find helpful.

**How:** Create or edit your GitHub profile by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner and selecting "Settings." Add a bio that highlights your interests.

### B. Highlight Your Projects:

To enrich your Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub, you can share and highlight your past projects. This is very simple to do by creating separate repositories for each of your projects that you wish to highlight.

**How:** Create new repositories for each project. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository." Name it clearly (e.g., "User-Manual-for-XYZ") and write a short description.

### C. Documentation Samples:

Keep your Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub well organized by creating separate folders for each type of document under each project repository. By doing this, you can easily help your viewers navigate through these project repositories to find specific files.

**How:** In each repository, create folders for different types of documentation (e.g., installation guides, how-to-articles). Use Markdown files (.md) for your documents. You can create a new file by clicking "Add file" > "Create new file."

### D. Open-Source Contributions:

Donâ€™t have any prior experience in technical writing and still want to create a Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub? One way to showcase your abilities is to fork open-source projects and showcase your editing abilities using these!

**How:** Find open-source projects on GitHub that need documentation help. Fork the repository (click on "Fork" at the top right), make your changes, and submit a pull request.

### E. Markdown:

Markdown is a fairly simple markup language to learn. You can learn it in about an hour and practice to make yourself better. A benefit of creating your Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub using markdown is to showcase your ability as a technical writer to explore markup languages and understand their code structures.

**How:** Use Markdown to format your documents. For example, create a README.md file in your repository that outlines the project. You can format headings, lists, and links easily. Check out the Markdown Guide for tips.

### F. Technical Skills:

Your README file contains all details regarding your project from its overview to the technologies you have used in it. This README file is the best place in your GitHub portfolio to list down all the tools and technologies you have used in a project.

**How:** In your README files, mention the tools youâ€™ve used (like Git or Sphinx) and provide links to any relevant documentation.

### G. Additional Tips:

These are some additional steps you can take to optimize your Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub:

- You can mention any blog or article links you might want to highlight using your README files.
- You can also include your contact info in your README file or GitHub profile settings to make it easy for potential employers to reach you.
- Add a section in your README or create a dedicated repository where you list certifications and courses youâ€™ve completed, linking to them when possible.
- Make it a habit to regularly check your repositories and update them with new projects or revisions. You can schedule reminders for yourself!

By including these elements in your Technical Writing Portfolio on GitHub, you'll create a strong presence on the platform. Happy writing!
