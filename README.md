# Technical Writing Portfolio

## About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shivanimarathe169 - 

I am a passionate technical writer specializing in creating clear and concise documentation for developers and users.
I am continually improving my skills by working on open-source projects and practicing the documentation of APIs, software manuals, and technical guides.

- 👀 I’m interested in Technical Writing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DITA XML, Markdown, HTML, API Documentation

## What I’m Practicing
My goal is to expand my expertise in the following areas of technical writing:

### 1. API Documentation
I am working on documenting open-source APIs, focusing on:
- **Endpoint Descriptions**: Explaining the functionality of various API endpoints.
- **Request and Response Structures**: Providing detailed examples of API calls, including parameters and expected responses.
- **Authentication Methods**: Describing how to authenticate with the API and what security measures are in place.
- **Error Handling**: Documenting common error codes and their solutions.

### 2. Project README Files
I practice writing detailed and well-structured README files that help developers and users quickly understand:
- The purpose of the project
- How to install, configure, and run the software
- Contribution guidelines for open-source collaboration
- License and other important information

### 3. User Guides and Manuals
I am developing my skills in creating user-centric manuals, focusing on:
- Step-by-step instructions for non-technical users
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- FAQ sections that help users solve problems independently

### 4. Contributing to Open-Source Documentation
I want to contribute to the documentation of open-source projects by:
- Improving the clarity and consistency of existing documentation
- Writing new sections for under-documented features
- Providing tutorials and how-to guides for developers using these projects
