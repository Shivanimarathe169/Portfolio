## Writing an Email: Step-by-Step Guide

Now before we begin, it is essential to know that you need to set up an email account before you can send any email. If you already have one, you can skip these steps. But if you don’t, please follow along.

### Step 1: Open Your Email Account

Log into your email account with your login credentials. For the sake of this tutorial, we will be using Gmail as our email provider. You should be able to view a screen similar to the one presented below:

![Open email account](<Open email account.jpg>)

Great! You should be able to see the inbox now.

![View inbox](<View inbox.jpg>)

#### Step 1.1: Create a new email account if you don’t have one

If you don’t already have an email account, create one using the steps below:

1. The first step is to click on the “create account” option if you don’t already have an account.
2. The next step is to select the reason for creating an account from the dropdown that will appear on screen once you click on the create account option.

Now that you are going to create an account, you will need to fill up the personal information displayed on screen. Once you fill in the sign-up form, you will be redirected to the login screen.

Yay! You are now logged in and all set to send that email!

### Step 3: Add Recipients

![Email drafting window](<Email drafting window.png>)

Start by adding the recipient’s email address in the “To” field.

#### Step 3.1: Add an email address to the “To: Main recipient(s)” field

The “To” field is where you will put the email address of the person you want to send the email to. For example: `christine@demoemail.com`

#### Step 3.2: Add Cc/Bcc (What these fields are and when to use them)

- **Cc** stands for “Carbon copy”. It allows you to send a copy of the email to someone else, with their address visible to other recipients.
- **Bcc** stands for “Blind carbon copy”. This allows you to send a copy to someone without revealing their email to other recipients.

---

### Step 4: Write a Subject Line

Now, write a subject line that includes the topic and motive of this email.

> **Tip:** Make sure that your subject line is crisp and short. The subject line should be short to read and convey your exact message.

For example:

`[Subject: Request for Project Update Meeting]`

---

### Step 5: Structure the Body of the Email

Now go on to writing the actual body of the email. You can follow the steps below to draft a great email.

#### Step 5.1: Insert a Greeting

Start your email with a great greeting.

- For work emails, stick to formal greetings like, “Hello, Respected Recipient, Respected Sir/Ma’am, To Whom It May Concern, etc.”
- For informal emails, you can use “Hi, Hello, Hey, Dear.”

#### Step 5.2: Main Content

Now, let’s move on to writing the main contents of the email body.

---

> **Tip:**  
> - Use clear and direct language.  
> - Prefer active voice over passive voice. For example, use "We have noticed..." instead of "It has been brought to our attention..."  
> - Keep the email short and to the point.  
> - Use text formatting like bold, italics, and underlines to give your email a good structure.

---

#### Formatting tips (paragraphs, bullet points, etc.)

Text formatting is a particularly important part of drafting any email. Especially in professional settings, use proper formatting to make your email easy to read.

> **Example: Email with Good Formatting**  
> Subject: Request for Project Update Meeting  
> Respected [Supervisor's Name],  
> I hope this email finds you well. I would like to schedule a meeting to provide updates on the progress of the [Project Name] and gather your input as we approach the next phase. Specifically, I would like to discuss:  
> - Recent milestones achieved  
> - Challenges encountered and possible solutions  
> - Upcoming deadlines and action items  
> Could you kindly suggest a convenient time for this week? I will ensure to accommodate your availability.  
> Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your guidance on this matter.  
> Best regards,  
> [Your Name]  

---

### Step 6: Insert a Proper Sign-off or Closing

Always use a sign-off while ending any email. This shows professionalism and respect for the recipient’s time.

> **Tip:**  
> Use a simple “thank you” followed by formal closings like, “Best Regards” or “Warm Regards.”

---

### Step 7: Insert a Signature (Optional)

You can add an automatic signature at the end of your email. This is optional but great for formal settings. Most email providers allow you to add a signature via settings.
